# New Database extension for Azure Data Studio
Adds 1-click database creation from the Databases folder in Object Explorer or from the command palette. Just choose the name and this will create it in the background for you.

## Usage
1. Right-click on the **Databases** folder for a SQL Server connection and select **New Database**. Type a database name and hit **Enter**.
2. Alternatively, use **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P** to open the command palette and type **New Database**. In this case, the current active connection will be used, and you will be prompted to confirm that it's the expected server.
