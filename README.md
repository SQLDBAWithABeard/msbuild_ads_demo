# Building extensions for Azure Data Studio Lab

The steps to build a new extension for Azure Data Studio are in this repository. You should be able to follow along using the notebooks here - start with `1_YoAzdata.ipynb` and step through from there. They can be viewed in Github, but we recommend using [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download) to follow along as it includes clickable actions.
